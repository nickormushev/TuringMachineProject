# TuringMachineProject
This is my Turing Machine project I made for my Data Structures class at university

# Description
The project contains the implementation of a branching, while and composite Turing Machine. There is no user interface and is just a bunch of unit tests. The input is taken from a file and uses the following syntax: 
    variableOnMemoryTape{stateOfTheMachine} -> replaceVariable{nextStateOfTheMachine}headMovement.
