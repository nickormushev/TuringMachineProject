Syntax docs:
what you read from the tape, with what you replace, go left(L), right(R) or stay in place(S), next state

The first line is the tape itself.
The next after MemoryTapeEnd are all the possible states.
The third secition is for all the connections between the tapes.
This Turing machine recognizes a^n b^n c^n languages
The first state is considered the start of the automata
